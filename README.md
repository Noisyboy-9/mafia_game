In spring 2021 I selected advanced programming course in [AUT](https://aut.ac.ir).<br>
This course had delivery projects for mid-term, and final term.<br>
This is the mid-term project.<br>
In this project we were tasked to create a command line version of Mafia party-game.<br>
The Lab practices can be found [here](https://github.com/Noisyboy-9/java_lab) <br>
The homeworks can be found [here](https://github.com/Noisyboy-9/mafia_game) <br>
